    <h1>History of Disasters</h1>
    <p>This page provides an overview of significant historical disasters.</p>
    
    <h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
Natural disasters comprise floods, storms, earthquakes, droughts, forest fires, heat waves, cold waves, frost, hail, and tsunamis, among other events. 
    <ul>
       <b> <li>2001:Gujarat Earthquakes</li></b>
		<p>Known as the Bhuj earthquake.</p>
		<p> The earthquake was caused by the collision between the Indian plate and 			the Eurasian Plate.</p>
		<p>The earthquake recorded 6.9 Mb on the Richter scale.</p>
		<p>Destroyed 300,000 homes and killed about 20000 people.</p>
		
       <b> <li>2004:Tsunami </li></b>
		<p>Tsunami triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake near the 			Indonesian island of Sumatra struck the southern coast on 26 December 2004. 		</p>
		<p>Death toll was 1,310, with about 5,600 missing</p>
		
	<b><li>2005:Kosi Floods</li></b>
		<p>To protect the Koshi River dam as well as the Koshi Barrage Pool's 			embankments, Indian engineers who are in charge of the dam in Nepal, 			further open the dam's gates which can cause flooding down river in 			Bihar.</p> 
		<p>2.64 million people in India and Nepal, taking lives and destroying 			livelihoods on both sides of the border.</p>
		<p>
	<b><li>2013:Uttarakhand Floods</li></b>
		<p>In June 2013, a mid-day cloudburst centered on the North Indian state of   		Uttarakhand caused devastating floods and landslides, becoming the 			country's worst natural disaster since the 2004 tsunami.</p>
		<p> More than 5,700 people were "presumed dead" and more than 4000 villages  		were affected, with an estimated loss of over INR 3,000 Crores1. Over 1,000 		people died and many more were missing.</p>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Man-Made Disasters</h2>
Man-made disasters comprise major fires and explosions, aviation and space disasters, shipping disasters, rail disasters, mining accidents, the collapse of buildings/bridges, and miscellaneous causes (including terrorism). These can be triggered by either human activities or negligence.
    <ul>
        <b><li>1984: Bhopal Gas tragedy.</li></b>
		<p>Toxic Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) gas leaked from the factory owned by Union 		Carbide.</p>
		<p>The tragedy was a result of human error and poor supervision at the 			factory</p>
		<p>This was one of the worst chemical disasters globally that resulted in 		over 10,000 losing their lives and over 5.5 lakh persons affected and 			suffering from agonizing injuries.</p>
		
        <b><li>2011:AMRI Hospital fire, Kolkata</li></b>
		<p> Happened because of negligence on part of management and operational 		staff, who did not implement most of the mandatory fire safety norms, as 		laid down by the government. Adding to this was lack of clear Standard 			Operating Procedures for such emergencies.</p>
		<p>A fire broke out at the basement of AMRI Hospital in Dhakuria area of 		Kolkata. </p>
		<p>The fire spread rapidly to the floors above. Patients were trapped   		inside wards and with no exit possible as all windows were grilled, the 		rapidly spreading smoke did more damage than the fire itself.</p>
		<p>160 persons inside the hospital at the time, 89 lost their lives, of  		which 85 were patients and 4 staff members.</p>
        <b><li>2010:Lalita Park Building Collapse</li></b>
		<p>The cause of collapse was attributed to poor quality of construction,   		illegal addition of floors and recent floods in the city, all contributing 		to the building crashing under its own weight.</p>
		<p>66 people lost their lives with over 80 injured</p>
	<b><li>2017:Mumbai Stampede</li></b>
		<p> It was raining at the time and there were already numerous people 			crammed into the narrow bridge.Someone may have slipped and fell when 			passengers resumed their travel after the rain, leading to the 				stampede.</p>
		<p> Atleast 23 people were killed and 39 others injured.[</p>
    </ul>
